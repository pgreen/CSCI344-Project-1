Design Inspirations

Below is a description of the two elements and the websites I took them from.

I chose the Orbit element from www.webcoursesbangkok.com.  I have seen several websites that use a slider and I wanted to learn how to use it. In foundation, I had to add the jquery script to the bottom of the index.html file to activate the slider and rotates the pictures.  The Orbit has a lot of options that can be used or change, but I kept it simple.  It wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be.

The slider in bootstrap was more difficult.  Bootstrap calls their slider a carousel.  It was harder to get the size I needed and the same pictures I used in foundation didn't fit well in this one.  Also the left or right arrow has to be clicked once to start the rotation of the pictures.  

The second element I chose is the 3 column layout with the icons at the top from www.Misterjekyll.be.  I have read articles in the past about how important it can be to make your web site user friendly by using Icon by headers when possible.   I didn't make the Icons a link, but they could be converted to links, for example, the music page could be accessed by clicking the music note.  I used my 4th icon at the top of the page by the header. It could link to the contacts page or when used in the header of other pages could link back to the home page. 

The grid in foundation made this 3 column layout very easy, but yet again it wasn't that simple in bootstrap.  The position on the page and the offsets were quite tricky.  When re-sizing the page it doesn't respond as well as the page I created in foundation.  So I would prefer to use foundation if given the choice.
