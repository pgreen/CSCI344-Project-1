          <h4>Just think how wonderfully it would be to have access to your ancestor's memories, along with photos and 
              music that tied those memories together for them.

        <p>I created Acquired Memories after a Lung Cancer Diagnosis.  After reading all the information I could find, I begin
            to think about how I wanted my family and friends to remember me.  I first thought I could write out how I wanted
            my memorial done and maybe create a CD for them to play along with some of my pictures.  I soon found out that I would
            not die from the Lung Cancer and I didn't do much thinking about this subject until my Mother passed.  I was the sibling
            put in charge of pulling together some photos to take to the memorial.  I didn't have access to all her pictures and really
            didn't have time.  Griefing and trying to do this at the same time really was a real struggle. So once again, I found myself
            wishing there was a way of combining music, photos, along with memories into one product, ahead of time, that could be left
            behind for who ever you choose to give to share them with.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        <p>This is why I created Acquired Memories.  This product could be used to give your Great Grandchildren a way they 
            could also feel like they could really get to know you.  The memories are yours and can be shared down through the years so 
            that they don't get lost.  This is just one way to use this product, there can be many, many more.  Have Fun.  It's free to try.
