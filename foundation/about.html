        <p>In 2007 I was Diagnosed with Lung Cancer.  This prompted me to begin thinking about how I wanted 
            my family and friends to remember me.  I first thought I could write down exactly how I wanted my memorial done 
            and maybe create a CD for them to play along with some of my pictures. Soon after I found out that It wasn't as
            bad as first thought, so I didn't think about this subject anymore until my Mother passed.
            I was the sibling put in charge of planning her memorial.  I didn't have access to any of her pictures and really
            didn't have time to find them.  Griefing and planning a memorial at the same time was a real struggle. So once 
            again, I found myself wishing there was a easy way of combining music, photos, and memories into one product. 
            Providing a file that could be shared and kept for those that are special to me.
        </p>
        <p>This is why I created Acquired Memories.  This product can be used to pass your memories in a unique way to generations to come. 
            The memories are yours and can be shared just the way you want.  You are in control of how you will be remembered. 
            It's really a lot of fun.
